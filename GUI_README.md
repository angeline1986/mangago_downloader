## 🛠️ Development

### Architecture
The GUI follows a modern MVC architecture:

- **Views**: Individual widget components (`search_widget.py`, `results_widget.py`, etc.)
- **Controllers**: Business logic controllers (`controllers.py`)
- **Models**: Data models from the core application
- **Styling**: Centralized theme management (`styles.py`)

### Key Components
- **MainWindow**: Central application window
- **SearchWidget**: Search interface with dual modes
- **ResultsWidget**: Results display with card layout
- **DetailsWidget**: Manga details and chapter selection
- **DownloadWidget**: Download configuration
- **ProgressWidget**: Real-time progress tracking

### Integration
The GUI integrates seamlessly with the existing core modules without modifying any of the original code:

- `src.search` - Manga searching
- `src.downloader` - Chapter downloading  
- `src.converter` - Format conversion
- `src.models` - Data structures
